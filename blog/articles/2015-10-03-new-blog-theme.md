I'm planning to bring a little more live into this blog again and therefore I needed a new theme.
The old one was too dark not suitable for reading longer texts. So I decided to invest a few hours
an put together some CSS for a new blog theme.

The new theme is supposed to be simple and optimized for readability - nothing fancy like all the
stuff you'll find on themeforest e.g. While choosing the new colors I stumbled
across [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) which seems to be a nice online tool to create color palettes
with focus on readability.

Additionally I decided to publish the [source code of this website on GitHub](https://github.com/nekudo/nekudo.com)
so anyone who is interested may have a look - or even contribute.
