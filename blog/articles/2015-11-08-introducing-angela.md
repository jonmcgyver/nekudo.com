In my last [post on gearman microservices](/blog/mircroservices-in-php-using-gearman) I already mentioned the
code I am using to manage Gearman workers in my applications. Now I have isolated the code from the rest of the
project and created a simple framework called **Angela**. It contains all the necessary methods to create and manage
Gearman workers in a PHP application.

The [sourcecode is available at GitHub](https://github.com/nekudo/Angela) including a demo folder which contains a
simple dummy application to illustrate the usage of this framework.

Feel free to check it out, contribute or submit issues.

Btw: Why Angela? Cause Angela is the boss ;)
